# gatos

`gatos` (cats, in Portuguese or Spanish) is a toy implementation of [cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/). My objective is not to have a production-grade library or even to fully implement all the functionality in the original `cats`.

This is highly experimental, a little playground to learn more about Category Theory, Functional Programming and Rust.
