# gatos

`gatos` (Portuguese for cats) is a toy library that provides functional programming abstractions and is heavily based on [cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/).

This is highly experimental, a little playground to learn more about Category Theory, Functional Programming and Rust. Also, this is very much work in progress.
